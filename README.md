# vetclinic-databases-projects

This Repository contains my database project. It has the commands input to create a database, create tables, edit tables as well as queries made. I also used primary key & foreign key mechanism for joining tables. Queried multiple tables. Prepared complex queries that answer analytical questions. Have integrated translations.

It uses the template provided by microverse.

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
